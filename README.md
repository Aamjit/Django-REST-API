### Building an API to display a list of books present in the database

### API

<p> API is an acronym for Application Programming Interface that software uses to access data(in web development) that separates back-end from the front-end. Representational State Transfer (REST) is an architectural style for an application program interface (API) first proposed in 2000 by Roy Fielding in his dissertation thesis. It is an approach to building APIs on top of the web, which means on top of the HTTP protocol. Every Restful API are stateless, supports common HTTP verbs (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.)  and returns data either in JSON or XML formats.
